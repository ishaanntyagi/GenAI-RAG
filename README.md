# GenAI-RAG

Welcome to the **GenAI-RAG** repository!

This repository was created as part of an internship prerequisite and focuses on Generative AI concepts and applications. It contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts demonstrating techniques, experiments, and use-cases relevant to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other generative AI workflows.
